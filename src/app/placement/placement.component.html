<h1>Training & Placement</h1>
<p>The training and placement team believes in the thought, “The outcome of education is apparent when careers sharpen your horizons” and we strive every minute working on it. Students’ skills are molded through multifarious training sessions that include technical, aptitude, verbal, soft skills and personality development. By understanding their level of grasping and delivering, the students are trained individually, based on their needs. To keep pace with the world, multiplicity of career is essential as it drives us to provide training and guidance for those who aspire to crack the competitive exams. The ambience in the Training and Placement department is an inspiration for its spatial dimensions of Interview cubicles, Group Discussion halls and Guest Lounge that render students a complete professional environment to learn and equip. A team of passionate staff work with a single motive for upgrading the students to the next phase of life by all possible means</p>
